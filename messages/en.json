      "p1": "I remember looking at the early start-pages of the internet and thinking, \"I could probably build that myself.\" While most people were still figuring out how to get online, I was reading articles in physical newspapers about a new concept called \"affiliate marketing.\"",
      "p2": "I took those paper-based lessons and applied them to the digital world—back when \"keyword stuffing\" was a legitimate strategy and I was learning how to command the attention of early search engines.",
      "p3": "The transition from hobby to business happened fast. While my peers were negotiating for a higher weekly allowance, I was busy scaling my first affiliate projects. By middle school, my digital commissions were already significantly higher than the pocket money I got from my parents.",
      "p4": "I started exploring AI in 2022, and by early 2023 I \"vibe coded\" BurnBacon—my first AI project—exploring how agents could collaborate and share memory. Strange to think it's already been three years. The tools keep evolving, but the curiosity that drove me in 1999 is the same one pushing me forward today."
