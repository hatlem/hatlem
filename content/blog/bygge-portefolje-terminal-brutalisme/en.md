## Intention over templates

I wanted a site that tells you something about me before you even read the "About" page. Not a template with swapped colors. Not generated by a prompt. Something that feels deliberate — technically raw, humanly considered.

The result is what I call terminal brutalism meets Nordic minimalism. Dark as a Norwegian winter night, with an aurora borealis teal accent and monospace typography everywhere. Zero rounded corners. That's not an oversight.

## The stack

The choices are deliberate and lean:

- **Next.js 16** with the App Router and React 19
- **TypeScript** everywhere — no escape hatches
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with PostCSS
- **next-intl** for full internationalization (Norwegian, English, German)
- **pnpm** as the package manager

No headless CMS, no database, no analytics SDK, no component library. Blog posts and project data live as typed TypeScript objects in the source code. It's a portfolio, and it knows it.

## The design philosophy

The CSS file opens with a comment declaring the approach: *"Terminal Brutalism + Post-AI Humanism. Anti-AI-slop. Intentionally human. Technically raw."*

The color palette draws from Norwegian winter nights — a near-black background, warm cream text, and an aurora borealis teal accent that appears throughout. There's a secondary "midnight sun" warmth color for contrast.

The details reward attention:

- **Noise and scan-line overlays** — subtle SVG-based film grain and a slow-moving CRT scan line add texture without being distracting
- **Kinetic typography** — the hero spells out "ANDREAS" letter by letter with a 3D rotation reveal animation
- **Terminal aesthetics** — command prompts, blinking cursors, and directory-style navigation
- **Brutalist cards** — content cards with offset shadow pseudo-elements that shift on hover, giving a raw, physical quality
- **Coordinates** — 59°54'N 10°45'E and a Norwegian flag in the corner. Oslo pride, baked into the layout.

## Trilingual from day one

The site ships in Norwegian (default), English, and German via next-intl. Each locale has its own complete message file and localized blog content — not machine-translated stubs, but genuinely adapted writing.

The language switcher shows flag emojis in the navigation, and the URL structure uses locale prefixes. Static params are pre-generated for all locales.

## No client-side data fetching

Everything is server-rendered. Blog posts, projects, translations — all resolved at build or request time. The client components are limited to scroll animations, navigation state, and the language switcher. That's it.

## The font pairing

Instrument Serif for display headings and JetBrains Mono for everything else. Serif + monospace is an uncommon combo that works because the brutalist context ties them together. The serif gives warmth and personality; the monospace gives it the technical edge.

> Built with intention, not templates.

The entire site went from create-next-app to full trilingual portfolio in a handful of commits. That's shipping speed in practice, not just blogged about.
