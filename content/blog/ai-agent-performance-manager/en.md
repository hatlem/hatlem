In 2026, marketing is no longer about clicking through endless menus in Meta Ads Manager. It's about steering agents — and creative work is more important than ever.

I recently tested Claude Code to set up a complete Meta campaign for one of the clients at Admirate, my agency. Using Playwright, the agent navigated through Ads Manager exactly like a human would. The result was an eye-opener for how our workday is about to change completely.

We've talked about AI in marketing for a long time, but with the launch of agentic tools like Claude Code and integrations with browser automation like Playwright, we've moved from text generation to pure execution.

## The Assignment: "Here are the images, here's the data – handle the rest"

The campaign was for an e-commerce client launching a new product line. My approach was simple. I gave Claude Code access to a folder with product images and videos, sent over some rough text drafts, and gave a specific instruction:

> "Look at our previous campaigns, figure out what worked best, and set up a new conversion campaign on Meta that mirrors that success."

Claude analyzed historical data, selected the most promising visual elements, and began building the campaign structure — including audiences, budget allocation, and ad formats.

## Like a Junior Consultant (for Better or Worse)

The most interesting thing about the experiment was the quality of work. Claude Code delivered at the level of a skilled junior consultant. It made no technical errors with the tool itself, but the "mistakes" that occurred were exclusively human — meaning mine.

When I wasn't clear enough in the brief, it made logical (but not necessarily optimal) choices. It required some small adjustments on my part after the entire campaign was set up, but the groundwork was rock solid.

## Why Creative Work Is Becoming More Important

Here's the paradox: The more AI takes over the technical work, the more crucial creative becomes.

When everyone can set up a technically perfect campaign with a few instructions, it's no longer the setup that separates winners from losers. It's the idea. The concept. The story you tell.

AI can optimize budgets and select the right audience. But it can't feel what resonates with an audience emotionally. It can't see cultural nuances or understand why *that particular* angle will create engagement.

This means marketers need to get better at what they should have always been best at: creative thinking.

## Do We Actually Save Time?

Here's the honest truth: It took Claude Code about the same time (maybe even a bit longer) to click through the process than if I had done it manually. But the value was in **cognitive offloading**.

While Claude worked through the repetitive setup:

- I could focus on strategy for next quarter
- I didn't have to sit with 15 tabs open uploading files one by one
- I functioned as a creative lead who approved the final result, rather than a production worker

## What This Means for the Industry

**For agencies:** Those still selling "campaign setup" as a service have a problem. Value is moving up the chain — to strategy, creative development, and advisory.

**For freelancers:** You can now deliver like a small agency. One person with the right tools can handle what previously required a team.

**For in-house teams:** Marketing departments need fewer "button pushers" and more people who can think. Job postings will change.

## Lessons for 2026

If you want to succeed with AI agents in marketing this year, three things matter:

**Good data is gold:** Claude performed so well because it had previous campaigns to learn from. Without history, the agent is blind.

**The folder is your brief:** By structuring images, video, and drafts in an organized folder beforehand, you minimize friction in execution.

**Clarity trumps everything:** The AI does exactly what you ask. If the result is "wrong," it's often because the instruction was ambiguous.

> The future belongs to those who learn to brief agents as well as they once briefed agencies — and who use the freed-up time to be creative.
